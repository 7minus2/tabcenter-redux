# TabCenter Redux

Your favorite vertical tabbed browsing addon, now compatible with Firefox 57+.  
  
A lot of features from the [original addon](https://github.com/bwinton/TabCenter/) are not ported yet, feel free to contribute!

## How can I contribute?

You need to have a recent version of node.  
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Run `npm run dev` and start hacking!  
   You can load the add-on temporarily in Firefox by navigating to `about:debugging` or by using the command-line tool [web-ext](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext).
